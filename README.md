**Wallet connection issues**
- Clear browser cache and cookies completely
- Try different wallet or browser (Chrome recommended)
- Check network is set to Sepolia testnet
- Disable browser extensions that might interfere

**Contract interaction failures**
- Verify contract addresses in configuration files
- Check if contracts are properly deployed and verified
- Ensure proper network connection to Sepolia
- Try refreshing the page and reconnecting wallet

**Dark mode not working properly**
- Clear browser localStorage completely
- Refresh the page and try theme toggle again
- Check if system theme detection is supported
- Disable browser extensions that modify page appearance

**Token balance not updating**
- Wait for transaction confirmation (usually 1-2 minutes)
- Refresh the page to force balance update
- Check transaction status on Etherscan
- Ensure wallet is connected to correct network

**Performance issues**
- Disable animations if experiencing lag
- Close other browser tabs to free memory
